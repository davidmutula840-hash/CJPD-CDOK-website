  <section class="about-intro container">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Catholic Justice and Peace Department (CJPD)</strong> of the <strong>Diocese of Kakamega</strong> is the social justice and advocacy arm of the Catholic Church. 
      It operates under the guidance of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) through the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission (CJPC) framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      CJPD Kakamega seeks to create a society where justice, peace, and human dignity are respected and promoted by empowering individuals and communities to live in harmony with one another and with God’s creation.

  <!-- Our History -->
  <section class="history container">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      The Catholic Justice and Peace Department was established in Kakamega Diocese as part of the Church’s commitment to social transformation. 
      Over the years, CJPD has played a vital role in civic education, voter awareness, peacebuilding, human rights advocacy, and environmental stewardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through partnerships with local parishes, government agencies, and faith-based organizations, CJPD has contributed significantly to promoting peace and good governance
