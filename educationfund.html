  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="education-intro container">
    <h2>About the Education Fund</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Catholic Justice and Peace Department (CJPD) Education Fund</strong> was established in <strong>2019</strong> as a diocesan initiative to support vulnerable learners from poor backgrounds who are unable to afford school fees.
      Through this fund, the Diocese of Kakamega continues to live out the Gospel message of love, justice, and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program focuses on providing scholarships, mentorship, and psychosocial support to students at secondary and university levels.
      It is a collaborative effort supported by parish communities, well-wishers, and faithful donors committed to social transformation through education.
